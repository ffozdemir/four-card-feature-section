## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my understanding of responsive design principles and CSS Grid. Here's an example of a CSS snippet I used:

```css
main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility and improving performance for larger-scale applications.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - A great resource for learning about responsive design.
